# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight about trends and patterns from high school standardized tests. After viewing the results, important decisions will be made including student funding.

## Results
### * How is the district summary affected?
 
   The school summary was affected when the scores of ninth graders from Thomas High School was changed. As shown in the images below, average math scores were changed. Although if round to the nearest whole number, the average math score decrease by 0.1 when rounding to the nearest tenth place. When rounding to the tenth place, average reading score before NaNs were added and after NaNs were added, had no significant change. When looking at the calculated percentage scores, if rounded to the nearest whole number, they would remain the same. Since we are comparing to the nearest tenth, we can see that percent passing math went down 0.2%, passing reading went down 0.1%, and overall passing scores when down 0.3%.
